**Alioune Tine** has been engaged on the issue of human rights for as long as he can remember. He contributed to the creation of RADDHO, an Africa-focused human rights organisation based in Senegal, in the 1990s. He was first in charge of External affairs, representative of the African Commission of the WHO, and then from 1998 onwards, he became the president of RADDHO. In 2013, he left RADDHO to become the president of the Senegalese Human Rights Committee and then the regional director of Amnesty for West and Central Africa. He is also the Independent Expert of the United Nations on the human rights situation in Mali and the founder of the think tank AfrikaJom Center.
