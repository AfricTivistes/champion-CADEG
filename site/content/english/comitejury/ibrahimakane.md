**Ibrahima Kane**,  the Deputy-Chairperson of the Panel of judges of the Champion initiative, is a special advisor to the executive director of the Open Society Foundation-Africa, in charge of advocacy with the African Union, and a lawyer in Senegal and France. Before joining the Open Society Foundation in 2007, he was a senior legal officer in charge of the Africa programme at INTERIGHTS for 10 years.

As a founding member of RADDHO, an Africa-focused human rights organisation based in Senegal, Kane led a programme focused on public education and women's rights in five West African countries - Cape Verde, Republic of Guinea, Republic of Guinea-Bissau, Mauritania and Senegal - for six years.

Ibrahima is particularly interested in economic, social and cultural rights, women's rights, the rights of migrants and refugees, issues of nationality on the African continent and the pursuit of justice through regional and international mechanisms. Over the past fifteen years, Kane has worked closely with the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights, the African Union Commission, the African Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, the ECOWAS Court of Justice and the East African Community (EAC) Court of Justice, and has pleaded before these bodies. He is an author and has coordinated the drafting and publication of several reports and articles on the African Union, the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights and the protection of human rights by the bodies of the regional economic community. He has also been an associate lecturer at the University of Essex School of Law from 2005 to 2011.
