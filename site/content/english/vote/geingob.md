  <p></p>President Hage Geingob, born in 1941, has provided remarkable leadership in favour of democracy and transparency in Namibia, as well as in continental governance. During his presidency, he has taken important steps to strengthen democratic institutions and promote citizen participation.
  <br></br>

  Under his leadership, Namibia has held several presidential and legislative elections that have generally been considered transparent and fair by international observers, thus maintaining free and fair elections. President Geingob has defended the right to freedom of expression and has encouraged an environment favourable to independent media, allowing constructive criticism of the government, thus promoting freedom of expression and the media.
  <br></br>

  He has implemented initiatives to combat corruption within the government and the civil service, thus strengthening accountability and transparency in governance. Under his leadership, the government has undertaken decentralisation efforts, transferring certain powers and resources to regional and local authorities, thus promoting better representation of citizens.
  <br></br>

  President Geingob has sought to involve historically marginalised groups more in decision-making processes, thus strengthening the representation and participation of all Namibians by promoting inclusion and diversity. Although challenges remain, these actions have contributed to deepening Namibian democracy under the presidency of Hage Geingob, whose leadership and commitment to democratic governance will leave a lasting legacy.

  <br></br>

  He died on 4 February 2024 in Windhoek.
  <br></br>

  Hage Geingob has received several awards and distinctions for his leadership, including the 2023 Lifetime Achievement Award from the African Energy Chamber at the African Energy Week conference in Cape Town.
  <br></br>
 
  2 principles of the ACDEG have guided the choice of President Geingob:
  The rule of law as stipulated in Article 4:
  "State Parties undertake to promote democracy, the principle of the rule of law and human rights."

  "State Parties consider popular participation through universal suffrage as an inalienable right of the peoples".

  Free and transparent elections as stipulated in Article 17: "State Parties reaffirm their commitment to regularly holding transparent, free and fair elections in accordance with the African Union's Declaration on the Principles Governing Democratic Elections in Africa".
