Late President Hage Geingob (1941-2024), demonstrated [remarkable leadership](https://medium.com/@DolapoAina/president-hage-geingob-three-tributes-to-the-great-namibian-pan-african-leader-f5d28c4268d4) in favour of [democracy and transparency](https://www.observer24.com.na/dr-hage-geingob-a-legacy-of-democracy-freedom-and-unity/) in Namibia, as well as in African governance. During his presidency, he took [important steps](https://theconversation.com/hage-geingob-namibian-president-who-played-a-modernising-role-222730) to strengthen democratic institutions and promote citizen participation.

Under his leadership, Namibia organised several presid ential and legislative elections that were generally considered transparent and fair by international observers, thus maintaining free and fair elections. President Geingob defended the [right to freedom of expression](https://allafrica.com/stories/202402250011.html) and encouraged a favourable environment for independent media, allowing constructive criticism of the government, thus promoting freedom of expression and the media.

He has implemented initiatives to [combat corruption](https://africa.cgtn.com/namibias-president-geingob-pledges-stronger-fight-against-corruption/) within the government and the civil service, thus strengthening accountability and transparency in governance. Under his leadership, the government undertook decentralisation efforts, transferring certain powers and resources to regional and local authorities, thus promoting better representation of citizens.

President Geingob sought to involve historically marginalised groups more closely in decision-making processes, thus strengthening the [representation and participation](https://www.observer24.com.na/promote-gender-equality-and-uphold-human-rights-geingob/) of all Namibians by promoting inclusion and diversity. Although challenges remain, these actions have contributed to deepening Namibian democracy under the presidency of Hage Geingob, whose leadership and commitment to democratic governance have left a [lasting legacy](https://press.un.org/en/2024/dsgsm1892.doc.htm).He passed away on 4 February 2024 in Windhoek.

Hage Geingob is the recipient of several [awards](https://mit.gov.na/documents/41692/111586/MINISTER+WINS+INTERNATIONAL+AWARD+++doc.pdf/3bd6b131-818d-d2fc-5bf2-f03a27f9acdc?t=1605627131545&download=true) and [accolades](https://www.observer24.com.na/geingob-receives-historic-award-at-cop-28/) for his leadership, including the 2023 Lifetime Achievement [Award](https://futuremedia.com.na/president-geingob-honored-with-lifetime-achievement-award/) from the African Energy Chamber at the African Energy Week conference in Cape Town, South Africa.
