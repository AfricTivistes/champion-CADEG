  <p></p>The Truth, Reconciliation and Reparations Commission (20 July 2017-15 October 2018) established in December 2017 had as its main objective to establish an impartial historical record of human rights violations committed between July 1994 and January 2017 under the presidency of Yahya Jammeh. It was also tasked with tracing the fate of disappeared victims and granting reparations to victims where necessary, and preventing the recurrence of violations by formulating recommendations to create appropriate prevention mechanisms, including institutional and legal reforms.

  One person, Dr. Lamin Sise, embodies the remarkable work of this commission, of which he became the president in 2021. He was born and raised in Gambia. From 2008 to 2011, Dr Sise was executive assistant, senior advisor and close confidant to the late Secretary-General Kofi Annan (Ghanaian diplomat, former UN Secretary-General).

  On 15 October 2018, President Adama Barrow appointed the 11 commissioners of the Truth, Reconciliation and Reparations Commission (TRRC), who were sworn in. The Commission began its hearings on 7 January 2019 and submitted its interim report to the government on 29 April 2020.

  On 24 December 2021, the TRRC released its final report, which lists the names of many people suspected of having perpetrated atrocities during the Jammeh era. Subsequently, in 2022, a White Paper from civil society on the TRRC report and recommendations was also produced by the CSO Working Group on Transitional Justice.

  The actions taken by the Truth and Justice Commission, as well as the start of reparations for crimes committed under Jammeh, deserve particular attention. The post-Yaya Jammeh regime has also implemented positive initiatives, including the requirement of due process before dismissing a civil servant on the recommendation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The ratification of treaties, the regular submission of periodic reports, and the acceptance and implementation of many recommendations highlight efforts towards governance reforms and the rule of law.
  <br></br>
  The Truth and Reconciliation Commission was chosen by the jury members for the application of the chapter on Governance Reforms and Rule of Law, whose Article 11 states that: "States Parties undertake to develop the necessary legislative and policy frameworks for the establishment and strengthening of a culture of democracy and peace". While Article 4-1 stipulates that: "States Parties undertake to promote democracy, the principle of the rule of law and human rights".
