Late Irene Chirwa Mambilima (1952-2021), former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, is renowned for her role in maintaining the [independence and integrity](https://judiciaryzambia.com/2016/08/08/hon-chief-justice-irene-mambilima/) of Zambia's judicial system, while promoting gender equality and social inclusion through her advocacy of the rule of law and the participation of women in political and public life. 

In 2002, she was appointed a Judge of the Supreme Court of Zambia, the highest court in that country's legal system. She then became Deputy Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. She strived to ensure that the court's decisions were impartial and based on the law.

She was appointed to chair the Electoral Commission of Zambia on several occasions, during several major elections. In this capacity, she chaired Zambia's presidential and parliamentary elections in 2006 and 2011, as well as the presidential by-election in January 2015. She earned a reputation for remaining impervious to outside pressure, vigilant in maintaining the rule of law and seeking to reassure voters that the elections were fair.
