  <p></p>Thuli Madonsela is a South African lawyer who participated in the drafting of the Constitution in the 1990s. On 19 October 2009, she was appointed Public Protector of the Republic (Ombudsman) by President Jacob Zuma (president from 9 May 2009 to 14 February 2018) for a non-renewable seven-year term from 19 October 2009 to 14 October 2016.  
  <br></br>

  As Public Protector, she gained a reputation for her integrity, courage and commitment to justice and political accountability, particularly in the Nkandla affair (2011-2012), where she denounced the excessive spending of President Jacob Zuma. Her reputation as a fighter against corruption has made her an iconic figure in the defence of human rights and good governance in South Africa and beyond
  The Public Protector is an independent institution in South Africa that plays a crucial role in protecting the rights of citizens and promoting good governance, by overseeing public administration and investigating citizens' complaints about abuse of power, corruption and maladministration. 
  <br></br>

  Benefitting from the unanimous support of the different parties present in the National Assembly, Thuli Madonsela, "Madam Anti-Corruption" due to her courage, tenacity and the precision of her investigations, became the worst nightmare of President Jacob Zuma  
   <br></br>
 
  At the end of her term, she became the holder of the chair of social justice at the Faculty of Law of the University of Stellenbosch in South Africa, a position she still holds.
  <br></br>

  She has received several distinctions. In 2014, Time magazine named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world. In 2015, she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Fort Hare and the University of Stellenbosch.

  <br></br>

  She was chosen by the jury members for embodying the institutionalisation of good governance. Article 32 of the ACDEG stipulates that "State Parties shall take the necessary measures to institutionalise good political governance." While Article 13 of the ACDEG stipulates that "State Parties shall take measures to establish and maintain dialogue and social trust, as well as transparency and accountability between political leaders and the population in order to consolidate democracy and peace."
  She now embodies integrity, courage, republican spirit and the fight against corruption.
