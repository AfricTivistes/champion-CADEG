  <p></p>The Supreme Court of Kenya has succeeded in developing a revolutionary Constitution of "endogenous" inspiration despite the major post-election crisis the country has experienced. Unlike other countries, the members of the Kenyan Supreme Court are not elected but appointed. It also remains one of the few, if not the only, constitutional courts to have annulled a presidential election due, according to the Supreme Court, to irregularities revealed in the transmission of results. The Kenyan judiciary has frequently annulled executive decisions, including the gender parity law.

  In 2020, the President of the Supreme Court of Kenya, David Maraga, asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to dissolve Parliament because it did not have enough women.

  This Supreme Court plays a crucial role in regulating the political and institutional game, helping to establish a culture of judicial independence in Kenya through its many precedents. The President of the Supreme Court, Judge David Maraga, delivered a historic verdict, annulling Uhuru Kenyatta's victory in 2017 and ordering new elections. According to the Supreme Court, the irregularities revealed in the transmission of the results were sufficient to cast doubt on the integrity of the poll. Uhuru Kenyatta's re-election will be validated following free and transparent elections.

  Before being appointed a High Court judge, David Maraga was a private law practitioner for 25 years, involved in civil and criminal litigation as well as property transfer cases. During this period, he also served as a judge at the commercial stands of the Nakuru Agricultural Show from 1985 to 1990.

  He left his position in 2020 after reaching retirement age. On 25 April 2024, David Maraga addressed the issue of corruption in Kenya and recommended key reform measures, on the occasion of the launch of the 3rd EACC (Ethics And Anti-Corruption Commission) workshop for media practitioners.

  In December 2023, the emeritus judge received an honorary degree from Kabarak University in Kenya.

  The Supreme Court under David Maraga (2016-2021) was chosen by the jury members for the application of the Democratic Institutions chapter of the CADEG. Article 15 of the CADEG states: "State Parties shall ensure that the Constitution guarantees the independence or autonomy of the said institutions."
