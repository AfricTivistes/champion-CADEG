The Supreme Court of Kenya stands out for its inspiring and bold decisions. The members of the Kenyan Supreme Court are nominated. This Supreme Court has made the fight against corruption a priority, ordering investigations and handing down firm rulings.

The Court also remains one of the few, if not the only, court on the African continent to have [cancelled a presidential election](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/09/01/africa/kenya-election/index.html) due to irregularities, underlining its independence and commitment to justice. The Kenyan judiciary has frequently overturned executive decisions. 

This Supreme Court plays a crucial role in regulating the political and institutional landscape, helping to establish a culture of judicial independence in Kenya through its many precedents. The President of the Supreme Court, Chief Justice  David Maraga, delivered a historic verdict, annulling Uhuru Kenyatta's victory in 2017 and ordering new presidential elections. According to the Supreme Court, the irregularities revealed in the transmission of the results were sufficient to cast doubt on the integrity of the poll. Uhuru Kenyatta's re-election will be validated following free and transparent elections.
