**The 2024 [AfricTivistes](https://africtivistes.com/en/) Champion of Governance and Democracy initiative was concluded on the sidelines of the Drive for Democracy Indaba, held in Johannesburg, South Africa. On 24 November, Thuli Madonsela was presented with the award in recognition of her exceptional contributions to the promotion of human rights and social justice in South Africa.**

Thuli Madonsela is the inaugural recipient of the AfricTivistes Champion of Governance and Democracy Award, an initiative launched by AfricTivistes.  


This African civil society-driven accolade honours an African public figure or institution that has demonstrated remarkable commitment to democratic principles and good governance as outlined in the African Charter on Democracy, Elections, and Governance (ACDEG).  

The triumph of the South African law professor marks the culmination of a rigorous and comprehensive process aimed at promoting the values of good governance, democracy, and institutional respect across Africa. This comes at a time when democratic gains are under threat in many countries due to the resurgence of coups, growing authoritarianism, and constitutional manipulation.  

“This award is a recognition and celebration of individuals and institutions whose actions embody true leadership and unwavering dedication to democratic values. It pays tribute to those who have made a lasting impact on democratic processes in Africa and whose work continues to inspire others,” stated Aisha Dabo, Programmes Coordinator at AfricTivistes. She added that the strength of this award lies in its emphasis on the principles enshrined in the African Governance Charter, with the involvement of civil society, media, and representatives of the nominees.  

The “AfricTivistes Champion of Democracy and Governance” Award is the result of a thorough process, including the identification of key figures by a selection committee, the establishment of [eligibility criteria](https://africtivistes.net/en/africtivistes-urges-african-citizens-to-choose-an-african-governance-democracy-champion/), and a final selection of five nominees by a [jury](https://democracychampion.net/en/comitejury/) panel. These committees comprise prominent members of African civil society organisations. Following the nomination phase, an open online public vote held over six months allowed the public to contribute to the selection process.  

The award ceremony took place on 24 November in Johannesburg, South Africa, in the presence of prominent figures from civil society and African political spheres. Among them were Alfredo Tjiurimo Hengari, Spokesperson for the Vice President of Namibia and Presidential Adviser; Opeyemi Adamolekun, founder of Enough is Enough (EiE) Nigeria; Boniface Mwangi, Kenyan activist; and Deus Valentine, Director of the Centre for Strategic Litigation.  

The ceremony was part of the Drive for Democracy Indaba held on 23-24 November 2024, which brought together key actors from civil society, social movements, artists, academics, legal experts, and African media representatives.

**Thuli Madonsela: A steadfast commitment to justice and democracy**

The *#AfricTivistes Champion of Governance and Democracy Award* is presented to Thuli Madonsela in recognition of her remarkable contributions to institutionalising good governance during her tenure as South Africa’s Public Protector.  
She is honoured for “her dedicated work as South Africa’s Public Protector, especially her investigation into the Nkandla scandal, has established a significant benchmark for political accountability,” noted Deus Valentine when announcing the awardee.  

Reacting to the announcement of the awardee, Gilles Yabi, founder of the Wathi Think Tank, stated that “This choice highlights the crucial role of independent institutions in consolidating and protecting democracy and the rule of law, as well as the importance of their constitutional nature.”

**Who is Thuli Madonsela?**  
Thuli Madonsela is a South African lawyer who participated in drafting the country’s Constitution in the 1990s. On 19 October 2009, she was appointed Public Protector by President Jacob Zuma for a single, non-renewable seven-year term (19 October 2009 to 14 October 2016).  
As Public Protector, she earned a reputation for her integrity, courage, and commitment to justice and political accountability, notably in the Nkandla case (2011–2012), where she exposed President Jacob Zuma’s excessive spending. Her reputation as a staunch anti-corruption advocate has made her an iconic figure in the defence of human rights and good governance in South Africa and beyond.  
The Champion initiative is implemented by AfricTivistes as part of the Charter Project Africa, which supports the implementation and adoption of the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance. The initiative is co-piloted by partner civil society organisations represented in the Advisory and Selection Committees.
